        <h1>Happy Birthday!</h1><br/>
        <p>To one of my favorite person in the world, happy birthday mem!</p>
        <p>I don’t think I could ever fully express just how grateful I am to have you in my life – you never fail to make us laugh, think deeply, and feel seen</p>
        <p>You have this incredible way of making everything better, from the most mundane moments to the most intense ones.</p>
        <p>I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been in a situation where your humor has been the exact thing to lift me out of bad vibes.</p>
        <p>You’re not just funny – you’re special.</p>
        <p>I know there’s no one else in the world quite like you, and that’s a rare gift. You’re such a unique, brilliant, and genuinely caring person, and I’m so lucky to have you as my friend.</p>
        <p>As you celebrate your day, I hope you know just how much you’re loved and how much you mean to everyone around you.</p>
        <p>You deserve all the happiness, success, and peace in the world. I will always be here to support you in every way that I can, and I’m so excited to see what this year of your life brings.</p>
        <p>I’m proud to walk through life with you by my side.</p>
        <h3>Happy Birthday again, mem. I love you so much!</h3>
